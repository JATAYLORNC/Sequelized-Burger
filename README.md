## About
Sequelized Burger is based on the Model View Controller software architecture and utilizes sequelize instead of an ORM.js object for setting up the data models.  Node Express, mySQL,and Javascript are used to set up the server and the database on the back-end including the required middleware.  Routes are set up in a the controller javascript file.  The front-end javascript file uses jQuery Ajax calls to send GET, POST, and PUT requests to the server.  Bootstrap 4 along with a custom CSS file is used to style the website.
