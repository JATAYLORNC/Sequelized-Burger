## About
Eat-Da-Burger is a full-stack website that utilizes Node Express, mySQL, and Javascript to set up the server and the database on the back-end including the required middleware and routers.  ORM.js is employed to wrap around the mySQL database, conduct the queries, and supply data to the application.  The front-end javascript files use jQuery Ajax calls to send GET, POST, and PUT requests to the server.  Bootstrap 4 along with a custom CSS file is used to style the website.  The application design is based on the Model View Controller software architecture.
